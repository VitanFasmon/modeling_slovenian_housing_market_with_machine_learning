Modeling Housing Supply and Construction Costs in Slovenia using Bootstrapping, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Machine Learning

Goal:

	To analyze how construction activity (building permits) and construction costs (indices) interact over time in Slovenia, and to use data-driven methods to:

		Quantify uncertainty in observed data using bootstrapping,

		Simulate possible future outcomes with Monte Carlo simulations, and

		Predict future building activity or costs using scikit-learn regression models.
2. Data sources and description

You’ll use two open datasets from OPSI (podatki.gov.si)
Building permits dataset

	Title: “Stavbe, za katere so bila izdana gradbena dovoljenja, Slovenija, mesečno”

	Frequency: Monthly

	Key features:

		Date (month)

		Type of building (residential/non-residential)

		Number of permits or floor area (m²)

	→ Proxy for future housing supply
Construction cost index dataset

	Title: “Indeksi gradbenih stroškov za nova stanovanja v gradbeništvu (četrtletje / povprečje leta 2021), Slovenija, četrtletno”

	Frequency: Quarterly

	Key features:

		Date (quarter)

		Index values for construction materials, labor, total cost

		Relative to base year (2021 = 100)

	→ Proxy for cost of building new housing
3. Data preparation
	Steps:

		Load datasets (pandas.read_csv() or read_excel())

		Convert dates to datetime format.

		Aggregate or resample both datasets to a common frequency (e.g., quarterly).

		Join datasets on the date column.

		Handle missing values — use interpolation, forward-fill, or bootstrap resampling.

		Normalize or scale numerical columns (for scikit-learn models).
4. Bootstrapping — estimate uncertainty

	You can use bootstrapping to understand the uncertainty in average or trend statistics.

	Example:

	Estimate confidence intervals for the average number of residential permits per quarter.
5. Monte Carlo simulation — model possible futures

	Monte Carlo is for probabilistic forecasting — generating possible future values based on historical variability.

	Example idea:

	Simulate the next 8 quarters (2 years) of building permits, assuming:

	You know the historical mean and variance.

	You model random variations using normal or empirical distributions.
6. Scikit-learn model — predictive learning

	Now add a predictive component using scikit-learn.
	This links construction costs to building activity.

	Example: Linear regression

	Try predicting building permits using construction cost indices and past permit data.
7. Visualization

Use matplotlib and seaborn for:

	Historical trends (time series)

	Bootstrapped distributions (histograms)

	Monte Carlo projections (shaded prediction intervals)

	Actual vs predicted permits (regression plots)
8. Interpretation & discussion

	Now interpret what your models mean for the Slovenian housing market:

	If construction costs continue to rise (e.g., due to inflation and labor shortages), our model predicts that the number of building permits will likely decline over the next two years.

	Monte Carlo simulations show a 70% probability that future building activity will stay below pre-2021 levels, implying a potential continuation of housing supply shortages and affordability challenges.
9. Incorporate Python Flux (web dashboard)

	You can use Python Flux (or Streamlit/Dash) to create a small interactive dashboard where:

	The user selects a date range or scenario (e.g., cost increase +5%),

	The app visualizes predicted permit numbers and uncertainty.

	That’s great for your seminar presentation.
